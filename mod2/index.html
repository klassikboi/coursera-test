            Woo, made this here with all the ice on in the booth
            At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
            Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
            This sh*t way too big when we pull up give me the loot
            (Gimme the loot!)
            Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
            Had to hit my old town to duck the news
            Two four hour lockdown, we made no moves
            Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
            I just landed in, Chase B mix this pop like Jamba Juice
            Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
            And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

            Back in high school, I used to bus it to the dance
            Now I hit the FBO with duffels in my hands (Woo!)
            I did half a Xan, 13 hours 'til I land
            Had me out like a light (Like a light)
            Like a light (Like a light)
            Like a light (Like a light)
